# Ideas Carlos
## Evaluation
 - Slidding window: The idea is that the most recent data is the most relevant. The hypothesis is that a model trained with the last year data is the best.

## Feature Engineering
 - Models with very few features
 - Is it possible to select different features based on combinations of brand/country?

## Modeling 
 - A model per brand/country
 - Can we transform the Y so the optimization mirrors better the metric
